Project Goals
-Understand critical path and the algorithm for finding it
-Learn about Object Oriented R programming (and R programming in general)
-Write well documented, publishable R code
-Submit R package to CRAN


Project Overview for R Critical Path

Goals for week 1 (Ending 7/14/17)
-Understand the problem
-Have a plan to attack it

Goals for week 2 (Ending 7/21/17)
-Get a working prototype
-The code does not have to be good, but it should work
 for standard cases

Goals week 3 (Ending 7/28/17)
-Tidy up/optimize the code from week 2
-Remove any unnecesary for-loops and replace
with vectorized operations for substantial speed-up
-Thoroughly test the code from week 2
-Implement rough draft Gantt chart code*
-Move code over to R package and begin documentation
-Benchmark code to see if there is any benefit to interfacing c++

Goals for week 4
-Finish Gantt chart code*
-Complete documentation
-Submit to CRAN

*Need to do research first to make sure this is a reasonable
feature
